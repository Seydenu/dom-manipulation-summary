<h1>DOM Manipulation Summary</h1>

<strong>DOM manipulation in JavaScript is the process of interacting with the DOM API to change or modify an HTML document that will be displayed in a web browser.</strong>

<p>There are many ways to manipulate the DOM.</p>

<h3>Adding elements to the page</h3>

<p>We're going to talk about different ways we can add elements to the page.</p>

<p>Firstly, you should select the element you'e going to be adding and you can append elements to it. And in appending, we have <strong>append</strong> & <strong>appendChild</strong>.For append, you can append strings or multiple strings and also with "divs", "spans". While the appendChild you can't append "strings" but only "divs", "span", etc.</p>

<p>To create an element in DOM, you can use document.createElement() and in the parenthesis you place the element you want to create. But it's good to know that after creating an element you'll have to add that element so it can be visible. And to add element to the body we'll use body.append(), and we'll also add the element name in the parenthesis like "div". And if we want to add atext to that "div" element, we'll say <strong>div.innerText = "Hello World"</strong>.</p>

<p>There's a difference between innerText & TextContent. TextContent is going to print you exactly the text content with all of the spacing & all the indentation of all the contents inside the "div", while innerText is different because it looks at the CSS to see, "is this actually visible on the screen?", if so, i'm going to give it to you, else i'm not. It display your text just as it should display in your HTML. innerHTML is the only way in JavaScript you can add HTML from a string into an element.</p>

<h3>Removing Elements from the page</h3>

<p>If we want to remove contents from the page, we'll need to write the element's name and the text we want to remove and then call the remove function. <strong>ex: spanBye.remove()</strong>. And incase we want to add it back we'll just do <strong>div.append(spanBye)</strong>.</p>

<p>There's something called <strong>"toggle"</strong>, it's actually used to add things if they're not already added and to remove things if they're already added and we want to remove it.</p>

<p>The style property is essentially the way to access any CSS property. If you want to set any CSS property, you just do <strong>style, dot(.), & then that property name and then you set it to whatever value you want.</strong></p>
